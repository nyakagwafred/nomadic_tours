# About the Project:
## Explanation:
This is a technical challenge or test that we shall use to gauge a potential tech co-founder's technical skills in building an e-commerce platform, and by extension his/her technical capacity for the tech co-founder role in The Mara Nomads.

## Task:
Design and implement a simplified version of an e-commerce platform (any e-commerce
platform you wish to design), focusing on the user registration, product listing, and shopping cart
functionalities.

## Requirements:
1. The application should allow users to register and create an account.
2. Users should be able to add products to their shopping cart and remove them from it.
3. Users should be able to view their shopping cart, update the quantity of items, and
proceed to checkout.
4. Products should be listed with their names, descriptions, prices, and images.
5. Products should be searchable by name and category.
6. The application should include at least one payment gateway integration, such as
Stripe, PayPal, Mpesa, Pesapal etc. whichever you want.

## Requirements:
 - You can use any programming language or web development framework of your
choice.
 - The UI doesn't need to be polished, but it should be usable and functional.
 - The project should be hosted on a public Git repository, and you should commit
frequently with clear commit messages.
- The code should be well-organized, documented, and maintainable.
- You should include unit tests and/or functional tests to ensure the application works
as expected.
- You have up to 7 days to complete the project.
